        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            The study of Home Economics as a distinct discipline was introduced in the country soon after the emergence
            of Pakistan.
            Initially, a separate department, devoted to the subject, was set-up in 1954 by the University of Peshawar,
            in collaboration
            with Colorado State University, USA. The department was later upgraded to College status in 1963. It is one
            of the four colleges
            in Pakistan devoted to the study of Home Economics, for developing a complete education programme for female
            students to meet the
            challenges of a free society. The institution equips young women with the specialized knowledge in the field
            of interior design,
            textile design, small business management, teaching, and research.
        </p>
        <p>
            This field of study extends opportunities for pursuing careers in any of the above professions. Therefore,
            it has acquired a special
            significance in moulding the female generation, providing them with an opportunity to study a unique blend
            of both science and art
            related subjects. It also opens up future avenues for personal, professional and social enhancement.
