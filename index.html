                Students play the role of backbone of every nation. They determine the future of every society.
                I personally am a staunch believer that it is only the education which determines the progress of
                an individual and a nation.

                The College of Home Economics is a unique institution of the University of Peshawar. The purpose of
                its establishment was to provide education with specific skills to female students in an environment
                conducive to the culture and traditions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Over the period of time the College has
                expanded in terms of its purpose and scope of its academic programmes. The college is now providing
                education in five specialized disciplines and preparing its graduates to serve the nation in diverse
                areas. The College has well-equipped laboratories and has qualified and devoted faculty members. Student's
                talent of entrepreneurship is promoted by whetting their creativity. Following in the footsteps of the other
                postgraduate institutions of University of Peshawar, the College of Home Economics has moved toward
                knowledge-based
                learning by encouraging the process of research among its students and faculty members. The effort of the
                Principal,
                Professor Dr. Shehnaz Khattak, is highly commendable and I have no doubt that the College will reach the
                pinnacle
                of glory under her able leadership with the support of motivated students and staff members.

                College of Home Economics is a unique and prestigious institution which offers a vista of diverse avenues
                for young entrepreneurs.
                It is a privilege to serve this institution which not only produces accomplished daughters, mothers, and
                wives but enables them to
                combat marketplace competition by excelling in their specific fields. My vision encompasses crossroads of
                unexplored opportunities
                for sprouting talent and my mission is to empower women in various roles. This institution provides a
                platform for exhibiting their
                latent potential, and we strive to polish those skills which will yield a promising outcome. College of Home
                Economics equips the
                students to face the challenges of professional life by refining those skills. Moreover, my preoccupation
                has always been to create
                a conducive environment for research and inquiry. Encouraging inquisitive mindsets among students is indeed
                vital for unprecedented
                discoveries. Having a highly qualified faculty at the College of Home Economics is a significant asset. The
                faculty strives to transform
                emerging talent into versatile entrepreneurs by expanding the horizon of knowledge and pushing back the
                boundaries from home to the marketplace.
                Transitioning from being homemakers to achieving professional excellence involves identifying inherent
                potential and pursuing relevant education.
                Keeping in view the currency of interdisciplinary subjects, the curriculum has been devised and revised to
                meet the emerging needs of Home
                Economics education in the marketplace. I hope to see this institution at the zenith of renowned glory in
                years ahead.
